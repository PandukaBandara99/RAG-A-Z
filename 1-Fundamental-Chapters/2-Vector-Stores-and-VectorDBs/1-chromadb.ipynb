    "**1. What is Chroma DB?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chroma DB** is an open-source vector database designed to efficiently store, manage, and query high-dimensional embeddings generated by machine learning models. It is optimized for similarity search, recommendation systems, and other applications that require working with vector representations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast vector similarity search using advanced indexing techniques.\n",
    "* Integrates seamlessly with machine learning pipelines.\n",
    "* Supports rich metadata for documents to enable contextual filtering.\n",
    "* Scales for both small projects and industrial-level workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Overview of Chroma DB**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma DB acts as a bridge between raw data and intelligent applications that rely on vector representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It stores **vectors (embeddings)** produced by models such as OpenAI embeddings, SentenceTransformers, etc.\n",
    "* Enables **efficient querying** to find vectors similar to a given input vector (nearest neighbor search).\n",
    "* Organizes data in **collections** with metadata for easier filtering and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Use Cases and Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma DB is widely used in scenarios involving **similarity search** and **semantic retrieval**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic Search:** Retrieve documents, images, or media relevant to a query vector.\n",
    "* **Recommendation Systems:** Suggest items similar to user preferences based on embeddings.\n",
    "* **Chatbots and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Retrieve contextually relevant documents for generating answers.\n",
    "* **Anomaly Detection:** Identify outliers in high-dimensional feature space.\n",
    "* **Image, Audio, and Video Search:** Use embeddings to find similar multimedia content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Vectors and Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vector:** A numeric representation of an object in high-dimensional space (e.g., `[0.23, -0.14, 0.98]`).\n",
    "* **Embedding:** A transformation of data (text, image, audio) into a vector, capturing semantic meaning.\n",
    "* **Similarity Search:** Use metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance to find vectors closest to a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Collections, Documents, and Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collection:** A container in Chroma DB to organize related vectors. Think of it as a table in relational databases.\n",
    "* **Document:** A single entry in a collection, usually consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Embedding vector**\n",
    "  * **Content** (optional raw data like text or image reference)\n",
    "  * **Metadata** (key-value pairs for filtering and organization)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Tenancy and Database Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tenancy:** Supports isolation of data for different users or applications.\n",
    "* **Database Hierarchy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Database:** Top-level container\n",
    "  * **Collection:** Logical grouping within a database\n",
    "  * **Document/Vector:** Individual entries within a collection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**5. Installation and Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "a. System Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher\n",
    "* **OS:** Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)\n",
    "* **Memory:** Dependent on dataset size, typically 8GB+ recommended for medium workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Installing Chroma DB\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma DB can be installed via Python’s `pip`:\n",

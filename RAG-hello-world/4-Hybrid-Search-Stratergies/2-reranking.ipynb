    "> Reranking is an advanced retrieval technique used to **improve the relevance of search results** by applying a secondary ranking model to an initial set of candidate documents retrieved from a primary search system (such as TF-IDF, BM25, or a dense vector retriever like FAISS or Pinecone).\n",
    "It plays a crucial role in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **hybrid retrieval pipelines**, where initial recall is broad, and reranking helps refine precision.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reranking is a **two-stage retrieval process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Retrieval (Stage 1):**\n",
    "   A fast retriever (like BM25 or a dense vector retriever) fetches the *top N* most relevant documents based on similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reranking (Stage 2):**\n",
    "   A more sophisticated model (often transformer-based, such as **cross-encoders**) re-evaluates those N documents against the query to produce a **more accurate relevance score** and reorder them.\n",
    "\n",
